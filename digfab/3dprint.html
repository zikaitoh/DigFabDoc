  <h2>3D printing a knight chess piece</h2>

<p>As part of our first fabrication project, we were tasked with modelling and printing a knight piece using an image from the internet.</p>
<img src="images/horsepic.png" alt="" style="width:50%">
<p>First, I took a random side profile image of a knight and put it on a canvas. I then drew a 50x30mm bounding box to have a reference for how big the piece should be.</p>
<img src="images/horsetrace.png" alt="" style="width:50%">
<p>I then manually traced the outline of the picture to the best of my abilities.</p>
<img src="images/horsemodel.png" alt="" style="width:50%">
<p>I extruded the finished sketch by 10mm and revolved the bottom part of the sketch.</p>
<img src="images/horseloaded.jpeg" alt=""style="width:50%">
<p>I exported the model as a .obj file and opened it in Ultimaker Cura. </p>
<img src="images/horse_supports.jpg" alt=""style="width:50%">
<p>I set the printing settings to the ones mentioned in class and sliced the model</p>
<img src="images/horse_preview.jpg" alt=""style="width:50%">
<p>Preview of the print, showing all the supports needed to print it.</p>

<p>Printing the piece, with a brim that helps with adhesion.</p>
<img src="images/horse_printing2.jpg" alt=""style="width:50%">
<p>another shot, now showing more of the supports.</p>
<img src="images/horse_done.jpg" alt=""style="width:50%">
<p>The finished print, which has a lot of supports, especially in hard-to-reach areas.</p>
<img src="images/horse_scratched.jpg" alt=""style="width:50%">
<p>My attempt at removing the supports with pliers and a penknife, which wasn't very effective.</p>
<br>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>I may have to find a way to require less supports, like reducing the number of >=90 degree overhangs.</p>
